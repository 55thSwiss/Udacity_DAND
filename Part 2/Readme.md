# Explore US Bikeshare Data
In this project we were asked to import data and compute descriptive statistics based on raw input from the user for an interactive experience using Python.

The datasets are too large to upload to GitHub (three datasets of ~300k lines each). When I get time later I'll take a sampling of the data and upload it here just for fooling around with the Python script.
